### **Privacy Policy for IsCool Bot**

**Effective Date**: Dec. 21, 2024

IsCool Bot ("the Bot," "we," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains what data IsCool Bot collects, how it is used, and the measures taken to ensure the privacy of users. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of data in accordance with this policy.

### 1. **Information We Collect**
IsCool Bot collects the following types of data in order to function properly:

- **Discord User IDs**: A unique identifier for each user within a server.
- **Discord Server IDs**: A unique identifier for each server where the Bot is installed.
- **Names Assigned by Server Admins**: Names assigned to users by server administrators when creating an "iscool" command (e.g., `houdert` in `/houdertiscool`). This name is tied to a specific user ID and is used for the purpose of saying someone is “cool” in the server.

This data is necessary for the Bot to perform its core function of creating and executing the “iscool” commands in the server.

### 2. **How We Use the Data**
We use the collected data for the following purposes:
- **To Power the "iscool" Command**: The primary purpose of the data collected is to allow server admins to create commands that assign a “cool” status to users. The Bot stores and uses the Discord user IDs, server IDs, and the custom names assigned to users by admins for this purpose.
- **To Maintain Bot Functionality**: We may use collected data to troubleshoot issues, improve the functionality of the Bot, and provide support for users and server admins.

### 3. **How We Store the Data**
- **Data Storage**: The data collected (user IDs, server IDs, and custom names) is stored securely on servers and is used exclusively for the purpose of providing the Bot’s services. Data is kept for as long as the "iscool" command is active in a server. Once the command or associated data is deleted or the Bot is removed from a server, the data is also deleted.
- **Data Retention**: We do not retain personal or sensitive data beyond what is necessary to provide the service. If you decide to remove an "iscool" command from your server using `/deleteiscoolcmd`, any stored data associated with that "iscool" command will also be deleted.

### 4. **Data Security**
We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 5. **Sharing and Disclosure of Data**
We do not share, sell, or trade the data we collect to third parties. We may share data in the following limited circumstances:
- **To Comply with Legal Obligations**: If required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request (e.g., a court order or government inquiry).
- **To Protect Rights or Property**: To protect our rights, the rights of users, or the safety of any individual.

### 6. **User Rights and Control**
As a user or server admin, you have the following rights:
- **Access and Update Data**: A user's "iscool" command name and user ID, and the server ID are all public info and usually accessible to anyone in the Discord server. You can modify the name associated with a user in your server’s "iscool" commands by running the `/makeusercool` command again with a new name (if you are an admin).
- **Delete Data**: If you are a server admin, you can use `/deleteiscoolcmd` to immediately completely delete any "iscool" command and its associated data
- **Request Data Deletion**: If you wish to have your data removed from the Bot’s database or have any concerns about your data, please contact us using one of the contact methods below.

### 7. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
